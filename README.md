This program is an implementation of a fully functional DMX interface in Processing.

The goal is to recreate something similar to myDMX 2.0, but without having to render out all of your effects and having smoother and more universal transitions between scenes. The other advantage to using processing to create this software is I plan to add a sound trigger option for each effect.

The current version of this software requires you to use the ENTTEC USBPro dmx encoder and it currently only supports RGB 3ch setup in lights, although I plan on expanding that in the not too distant future.

This will give you a range of functions for drawing scenes, transitioning between scenes, and interconnectivity for outside input through both MIDI and an external audio input.

The future of this project is intended to be a complete theatrical show control software with an array of intellegent interactivity between different input sources such as microphones, depth sensors (Kinect and equivalent), and other sources of video.
