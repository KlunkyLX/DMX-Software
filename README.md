# DMX-Software
An attempt to create a fully functional DMX interface in processing.

The goal is to recreate something similar to myDMX 2.0, but without having to render out all of your effects and having smoother and more universal transitions between scenes. 

This will give you a range of functions for drawing scenes, transitioning between scenes, and interconnectivity for outside input through both MIDI and an external audio input.
